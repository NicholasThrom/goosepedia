# goosepedia

A version of wikipedia but everything is about geese.

It can be seen at [goosepedia.site](http://goosepedia.site/).
If it doesn't work for you, the DNS servers might be a little slow,
so I've pointed [jsos.website](http://jsos.website)
at it temporarily.

There are three mechanisms to make everything about geese:

## Proper Noun Replacement

Based on context, the proper nouns are collected and classified.

60% of them are chosen to be replaced
with a goose-related proper noun that (sometimes) fits.
Replacements are consistent across different uses,
to make the articles slightly more coherent.

## Regular replacement

A list of over 150 word replacements is iterated through,
to make sure the content of the article is goose-related.

This isn't very technically challenging but took a while.

## Image replacement

Most images are replaced with a goose-related image.
