# goosepedia

A version of wikipedia but everything is about geese.

Currently, I'm hosting it at [jsos.website](http://jsos.website/),
since the DNS servers are taking too long.

Once the DNS servers have updated it will be at (goosepedia.site)[http://jsos.website/].

There are three mechanisms to make everything about geese:

## Proper Noun Replacement

Based on context, the proper nouns are collected and classified.

60% of them are chosen to be replaced
with a goose-related proper noun that (sometimes) fits.
Replacements are consistent across different uses,
to make the articles slightly more coherent.

## Regular replacement

A list of 150 word replacements is iterated through,
to make sure the content of the article is goose-related.

This isn't very technically challenging but took a while.

## Image replacement

Most images are replaced with a goose-related image.
